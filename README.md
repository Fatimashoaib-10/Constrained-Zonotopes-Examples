# Constrained-Zonotopes-Examples
Guaranteed State Estimation via Remainder-Form Decomposition Function-Based Set Inclusion for Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems. This proposed method is applied on two examples. 
These codes were developed as my final Masters thesis. This thesis proposes novel set-theoretic approaches for state estimation in boundederror discrete-time nonlinear systems, subject to nonlinear observations/constraints.
By transforming the polytopic sets that are characterized as zonotope bundles (ZB)
and/or constrained zonotopes (CZ), from the state space to the space of the generators of ZB/CZ, a recent result on remainder-form mixed-monotone decomposition
functions is leveraged to compute the propagated set, i.e., a ZB/CZ that is guaranteed to enclose the set of the state trajectories of the considered system. Further,
by applying the remainder-form decomposition functions to the nonlinear observation function, the updated set is derived, i.e., an enclosing ZB/CZ of the intersection
of the propagated set and the set of states that are compatible/consistent with the
observations/constraints. Finally, it is shown that the mean value extension result in
Rego et al. (2020) for computing propagated sets can also be extended to compute
the updated set when the observation function is nonlinear.
